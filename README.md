# 👤 Simple User Manager

This is a simple project I created using **Batch File (.bat)**.  
The goal of this program is to build a very basic user-management system  
and to help me practice the fundamentals of Batch scripting.

The program runs in the Windows command prompt and lets you add users,  
view them, or delete them using a small text-based menu.

I am still new to Batch scripting, so this project is mainly for learning  
and improving my skills 😊.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. When the program starts, it asks for a login password  
2. If the password is correct, the main menu appears  
3. You can add users, view them, or delete them  
4. All data is stored in a text file called `users_data.txt`

This project helped me understand and practice:

- `echo`  
- `set` and input handling  
- `if` / `else` conditions  
- `goto` labels  
- File operations like `type` and `del`  
- Simple menu flow and logic
